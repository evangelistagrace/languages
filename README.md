# languages
Language repository for Vecta.io. Currently available in French, Japanese, and Swedish. You can now contribute and improve on Vecta.io translation, or even add on new languages for yourself and also for other native speakers like you.

The only language file we have created is in English, and the rest are done using google-api-translation. If you want to add a new language file, just create a new [language_code].json file. Content structuring and translation should only be made based on en.json (english) file.
